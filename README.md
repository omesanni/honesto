# Honesto
This app was built with ReactJS.

If I had 1 week to build the app, I will work on the modularity of the components
by breaking them into smaller ones. I will also work on the CSS styles to eliminate
redundancy in things like colors, font-sizes, padding etc.

Currently, the feedback submitted by a user is shown in a modal when the view submission
button is clicked. If there was more time I'll probably display each submission on a new page.

## Start app thru docker
1. `docker run -i -t -p 3000:3000 omesanni/honesto`
2. `Open browser at http://localhost:3000`

## Start app locally
1. `Make sure you have node (v7.2.0 and above) and npm installed on your system`
2. `Clone this repo`
3. `npm install`
4. `npm start`
5. `Open browser at http://localhost:3000`
